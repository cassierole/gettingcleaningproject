# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is demonstrate how to clean and analyze data in order to prepare a tidy data set. Source files are appropriately combined, relevant variables extracted, and the data analyzed, resulting in the creation of a new, independent tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

### Instructions:
* run_analysis.R assumes that the dataset described in the Code Book is unzipped in the working directory, and that the data.table and dplyr packages have been installed using install.packages("data.table") and install.packages("dplyr").
* Load the R script using source("run_analysis.R")
* Run the R script using run_analysis()
* A text file tidyAnalysis.txt will appear in the working directory containing the averages for each variable for each subject and activity.
* Descriptions of the variables are available in the Code Book.
